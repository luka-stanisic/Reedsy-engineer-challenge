## 1. About you

Tell us about one of your commercial projects with Vue.js or AngularJS.

> The last project I worked on was as part of a Tezos development team - it was a sort of debug tool specially designed for blockchain developers. It was a very challenging project where we've delved into some low-level stuff, but also really rewarding since we had lots of feedback from the community of developers that were actually using the app and seeing how it made their lives easier.
