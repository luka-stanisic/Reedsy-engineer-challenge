## 2. General

##### 2.1. What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?


> Of course a great team is always number one, but other than that I like working on projects that have a direct impact on users. Where users can appreciate all the little details and care about the app being good.

##### 2.2. Which are your favorite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?

> Haven't really thought about it until now, but I guess it would be the email input type. It's just simple and useful.

##### 2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting `innerHTML` and using `createElement`.

> I think the most notable difference would be that with innerHTML we are recreating all DOM nodes each time we want to add, while with createElement we are merely appending the new element.

##### 2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.

> Well first they are both describing ways in which data is "linked" to the view. As the names themseves suggest, two-way binding implies that it flows both ways (changes in component will reflect on the view, and changes in the view will reflect on the component), while one-way flow means only the view will update if data changes in component.

##### 2.5. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?

> It greatly improves the user experience and overall performance by allowing some potentially heavy process to run without blocking everything else.
